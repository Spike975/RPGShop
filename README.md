# RPG Shop
This is/will be a RPG shop where the user will be able to buy and sell items via a console window.
It will have an array of different variables for both the player and the shopkeep.
This will allow the player to keep track of their items, while also seeing the value at which they can be sold.
Top start off, the player will get basic/begining items, which are going to be loaded from a text file.

I will aslo be trying to add a short little adventure simulator for you to gear up, fight monsters, and gain more more gear to equip or sell, if time permits.
Items will have different attack and armor values based off the quality and the type of equipment all stemming from an original class.
For the enemies, there will be a base class to initialize all of their stats, then sub-classes to change/update the stats. 
Both enimies and items will have a their own class to seperate the code.
To save progress, all items in the player's inventory and the shopkeep's inventory will be saved in different text files.

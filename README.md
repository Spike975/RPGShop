# RPG Shop
This is/will be a RPG shop where the user will be able to buy and sell items via a console window.
It will utilize Dictionaries to hold all of the items and the price of those items for both the player and the shopkeep.(at least that's the hope. If not, it will be two arrays for each).
I will aslo be trying to add a short little adventure simulator for you to gear up, fight monsters, and gain more more gear to equip or sell, if time permits.
To save progress, all items in the player's inventory and the shopkeep's inventory will be saved in different text files.

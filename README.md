# RPG Shop
This is/will be a RPG shop where the user will be able to buy and sell items via a console window.
It will have an array of different variables for both the player and the shopkeep.
This will allow the player to keep track of their items, while also seeing the value at which they can be sold.
Top start off, the player will get basic/begining items, which are going to be loaded from a text file.

There is also an adventure simulator for you to gear up, fight monsters, and gain more gold to buy more items from the shop.
Items will have different attack and armor values based off the quality and the type of equipment all stemming from an original class.
There are two different adventures. One is exploration. Here you can explore an area and fight smaller enemies to gain small mounts of gold. You can also Fight bosses to gain a large amount of gold. 

To save progress, all items in the player's inventory and the shopkeep's inventory will be saved in different text files when they enter the inn.
